This project is a Tauri application built with React and TypeScript.

It is to serve as a desktop application that provides various statistics and information for Minecraft players.

It can show different types of farms in the game, along with their efficiency and other relevant data. It should also show statistics for mobs, biomes, items, and other aspects within Minecraft. Essentially, it is like a encyclopedia or database for Minecraft players to reference while playing the game.

Example use cases:

1. A player in the early game stages wants to know the best way to set up a basic iron farm for resources.

1.1 They open the application, navigate to the iron farm section/ search, and find a simple design with step-by-step instructions.

1.2 The application shows them the materials needed, the farm's efficiency, and tips for optimal placement.
